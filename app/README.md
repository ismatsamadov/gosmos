# Gosmos, the app

A native macOS app (SwiftUI, with AppKit where SwiftUI falls short) for studying Go courses
offline. It opens a **library**: one SQLite file with courses, their lessons and your progress
in them (`../docs/library-format.md` is the format). Any library works the same. The app checks
your code with your own Go toolchain and keeps your study data in the library file; when the
file sits in a git work tree, it commits, pushes and pulls it when you ask. How it is built is
in `../docs/architecture.md`, how it looks in `../docs/design.md`.

## Build, install, run

From the repository root, with the Command Line Tools (no Xcode needed) on macOS 27:

```sh
make install
```

That builds `build/Gosmos.app` (release build, Info.plist, icon, ad-hoc signature) and
copies it to `~/Applications`. Open it from Spotlight or Launchpad. `make app` only builds.

The app opens the library its `LibraryPath` setting names, or none the first time. Open one
with File > Open Library… (⌘O) or File > Open Recent, or in Settings > General. Before any of it is shown, a
library passes the format's checks, the same as `go run ./cmd/library check <file>`; a file
that fails is refused with the problems the checks found.

## Test

```sh
make test                      # go vet ./..., go test ./... and swift test
swift test --package-path app  # the app's tests only
```

The tests build their own libraries from `db/schema.sql` in `$TMPDIR`, with made-up lessons;
no test reads a real library. Some run a real `go build` / `go test` and are skipped when Go
is not installed. The git tests use a throwaway repository and bare remote in `$TMPDIR`.

## Where things are

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Lessons and your study data | The library file (progress, attempts, notes, code, projects, server addresses, settings) |
| Lesson folders for building and running | `~/Library/Caches/Gosmos/work/<lesson uuid>/`, disposable; each run keeps its build files in `work/.runs` while it lasts |
| Settings for this Mac | UserDefaults `io.github.jobloom.Gosmos`: the library's path and recent libraries, the Go path, window layout, the last push |

Your code lives in the database. To run it, the app writes a lesson's files to its work
folder (your files, the read-only tests, `go.mod`, the readme) and builds there; hidden
helper files are added with `go build -overlay`. Edits you make in another editor (Lesson >
Open Lesson Folder in Editor) are taken in when you come back to the app and before every
save and run. If you changed the same file in the app too, it asks which version to keep.

A tests lesson passes when `go test` passes and the tests report no failed case themselves:
some lesson tests print Fail and a summary such as "0 passed, 5 failed" without failing the
test, so the exit status alone is not enough. A code lesson in another language than Go
opens and can be read and edited, but the console says Gosmos runs Go lessons.

## Command-line lessons

Commands run in the course's project folder, which you choose once per course. A lesson's
`${baseURL}` is the server address it suggests, or yours for it: an address you enter
replaces that suggestion for every lesson that makes it, and Use Suggested goes back. A
lesson that checks a server you deployed suggests none and asks for your server's address,
which the course keeps.

## Git

When it opens a library, the app asks git whether the file sits in a work tree (`git -C <its
folder> rev-parse --show-toplevel`) and whether git tracks the file. If it does, Commit and
Push Now and Pull (in the File menu and Settings > Sync) work on it; the app never pulls,
commits or pushes on its own. A commit takes only the library file (`git commit --only`, which leaves anything else
you staged alone) and then pushes. A pull is `git pull --ff-only`, with the file closed while
git replaces it. The app never merges; a conflict or a failed push shows under the sidebar and
in Settings > Sync. A library outside a work tree, or one git does not track, stays on this
Mac, and Settings > Sync says so.

Git steps run one at a time, and git is never killed outright: a step that takes too long
gets SIGTERM and time to remove its lock file. If `.git/index.lock` is left over while no git
is running, the app says so and offers to remove it.

## Keyboard

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| ⌘R | Run (or Run Checks) |
| ⌘↩ | Submit |
| ⌘. | Stop |
| ⌘] / ⌘[ | Next / previous lesson |
| ⌥⌘← / ⌥⌘→ | Back / forward through lessons you visited |
| 1 to 5 | Pick a quiz answer |
| ⇧⌘D | Mark as done |
| ⇧⌘R / ⇧⌘O | Reveal the lesson folder in Finder / open it in your editor |
| ⌥⌘I | Show the inspector (note and lesson facts) |
| ⌘= / ⌘- / ⌘0 | Bigger / smaller / actual-size code |

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Sources/GosmosKit` | Models and services, no SwiftUI or AppKit: the database (GRDB), readmes (swift-markdown), the Go lexer, process running, the Go toolchain, code runs, command-line checks, git |
| `Sources/Gosmos` | The SwiftUI app: models, views, rendering |
| `Tests/GosmosKitTests` | Swift Testing tests |
| `Packages/` | Local packages: the HTTP client for checks, jq, the code editor |
| `Resources/` | `Info.plist` and `AppIcon.icns` |
| `scripts/bundle.sh` | Assembles and signs the .app (`make app` runs it) |
| `scripts/make-icon.sh` | Redraws `Resources/AppIcon.icns` from `scripts/make-icon.swift` |

## Scripted runs

Two launch arguments help with screenshots and debugging; they are read from the command line
only and never stored:

```sh
open -n build/Gosmos.app --args -GosmosOpenLesson <lesson uuid> -GosmosLaunchAction run
```

The action is one of `run`, `submit`, `check`, `answer` (answers a quiz), `footer` (scrolls to
the part below the readme), `settings` (opens Settings), `walk` (opens the next ten lessons) or
`search:<text>` (types a search). `-LibraryPath <file>` opens another library for that launch.
